पर जीत कर भी कर्ण के हारे हुए-से प्राण थे

क्या, सत्य ही, जय के लिए केवल नहीं बल चाहिए
कुछ बुद्धि का भी घात; कुछ छल-छद्म-कौशल चाहिए

क्या भाग्य का आघात है !
कैसी अनोखी बात है ?

मोती छिपे आते किसी के आँसुओं के तार में,
हँसता कहीं अभिशाप ही आनन्द के उच्चार में।

- रश्मिरथी (षष्ठ सर्ग), रामधारी सिंह दिनकर

On the 14th night of the Mahabharata, the battle continued past sunset, following Jayadratha’s fall. Ghatotkacha emerged as the most destructive force, with his powers heightened by the night (as demons’ abilities are stronger after dark), wreaking havoc on the Kaurava army. Even Duryodhana had to flee as his forces crumbled. In desperation, Karna unleashed the Vasavi Śhakti, a weapon granted by Lord Indra, which could only be used once. Karna had saved it for Arjuna, but to protect his army, he used it against Ghatotkacha, killing him.

The Kaurava camp celebrated Ghatotkacha’s death as a victory, while the Pandavas mourned a great loss. Yet two individuals felt differently: Karna, who was plunged into sorrow, knowing he had lost his one chance against Arjuna despite the celebrations around him, and Krishna, who smiled amid the sorrow, knowing he had ensured Arjuna’s survival by sacrificing Ghatotkacha.

Sometimes in life, only you know you’ve lost, even when everyone else is celebrating your win. And other times, only God knows you’ve won, even when you feel the weight of loss.`
