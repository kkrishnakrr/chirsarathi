Have you ever noticed how as we age, time seems to slip through our fingers like grains of sand? Each passing year feels like a mere blink compared to the vast expanse of our earlier years. Reflecting on this phenomenon, I'm struck by the profound wisdom it holds.

Think of the year 19 in COVID'19, it is half a decade now or the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which now stretches beyond years. It's astonishing how swiftly time moves, carrying with it the weight of our experiences and memories.

I recently came across an insightful perspective on this temporal paradox: the older we become, the faster time appears to pass.

How?

Because each passing year represents a smaller fraction of our total life experience. Think about it: for a 9-year-old, their 10th year comprises one-tenth of their entire life. But for someone who's 19, that same year constitutes just one-twentieth of their existence.

This realisation offers a poignant reminder to savour each moment, to infuse our days with purpose and meaning.
