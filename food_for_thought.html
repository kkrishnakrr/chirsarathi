How so many religious texts of ancient religions were passed on generations by generations in an oral tradition. Nothing documented. And most of those were poetic verses, passed on as it is, not paragraphs which people could have their own rephrased versions.\n\n2. How rocks and marbles in pyramids and other ancient monuments were stacked upon in such a stable manner as if they are produced by some of the best in class engineers even very few of that grade engineers we have today.\n\n3. I was recently reading about the excavations of ancient civilisations like Indus-Valley, Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient China. The level of societal and infrastructural organisations discovered blows the mind.\n\n4. In India we have thousands of temple which are at least a thousand years old, ever in doubt about it then take a trip to Bhubaneswar in Odisha, and stand right in front of one such temple to appreciate the level of design and engineering intricacies in the temple structure. It blows the mind to think these were produced at least a thousand years or more in past.\n\n5. Read about the recent and earlier discoveries from the the relics of Ratnagiri, buddhist heritage site in Odisha’s Jajpur district, what all things were unearthed are masterpiece of hammered stone art.\n\nToday with highly capable electronic devices, internet access to 5.5 billion people (about 70% of the world population), it appears as most of us are much more resourceful and capable than collective mind powers from 2500 years back, yet most of us are progressing in our individual lives at very incremental level or none at all.\n\nNot sure is it the curse of abundance problem. But certainly there is something missing which is making our individual world more and more hollow even after we think of ourselves much more resourceful than the collective civilisations 2500 years ago.' },

And how easily the user can achieve that outcome for themselves is the simplicity, and in how little time they do so is your minimalism.\n\nAnd sometimes it requires putting an additional CTA, copy, or screen in order to achieve this outcome flawlessly. And the piece of art is how you can boil down to reduce these to the minimum without compromising the delight in the process of the user achieving the desired outcome.' },
            { id: 'speed-of-light', title: 'Speed of Light', date: '2025-01-19', content: '<strong>No one has ever measured the speed of light.</strong> Yes, you read it right.\n\nNo one has ever measured the speed of light because of the difficulty it poses in the fundamentals of measuring any event in time: that is to take the correct measurement of time at the start of the event and at the end of the event using either the same clock or two synced clocks.\n\nSo, then what is this c = 299,792,458 metres per second in vacuum? We fundamentally use it everywhere in physics and life, even to define the unit of length meter, as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 seconds."\n\nSee, what happens is that in order to measure the speed of light we need to measure how much time it takes for light to travel from point A to point B. And in order to do so, we need to take the timestamps of when light starts at Point A and then when light reaches Point B.\n\nBut it is impossible to measure these times accurately with one or more clocks because of some hard-core challenges posed by quantum physics and relativity (beyond the scope of this post).\n\nSo, in order to resolve this, we measured the two-way speed of light. Start the light from point A, it hits a perfect mirror at an angle at point B, and it reflects back to be received at point C, which is exactly below point A.\n\nAnd then we measured the time it takes for the light to complete this journey and the distance it travelled. Now, by dividing this distance upon the time gives us the speed of light we know as of today. But mind it, this is an average speed with which light completed this two-way journey, not the speeds of individual one-way journeys.\n\nBut let me make you think this: What if the speed of light in the forward direction and the backward direction are different? What if the light travelled faster from point A to the mirror and then slowed down from the mirror to point B on its return journey or vice versa?\n\nI know this is crazy to think, but this is not impossible, at least theoretically.\n\nBut then why are we so comfortable with this average two-way speed of light as we know and easily treat it as a fundamental? We accept this as a workable constant and build everything around it—from defining the unit of length to formulating Einstein’s theories. Why so?\n\nBecause, sometimes it is better to leave the things which are currently beyond our capability in the unknown and move ahead with what we can know, and especially when it does not significantly affect our understanding of the world.\n\nThe good thing is even if light does its forward and backward journey with different speeds, still it would not make any major change in our understanding of physics and the universe as far as practicality is concerned.\n\nThis approach isn’t about ignoring the unknown. It’s about working with what we do know and moving forward.\n\nHence, we beautifully leave this unknown and let whatever we can know guide our journey of finding the truth of matter, energy, and other things in our life and universe.\n\nThis idea isn’t just relevant to physics; it’s a lesson for life and work.' },
            {id: 'first-principle-empathy', title: 'First Principle and Empathy', date: '2025-01-07', content: `Among product folks, <strong>first principle thinking</strong> is always appreciated, but it is intrinsically linked to how empathetic you are in general.\n\nYour first principle thinking heavily depends on your life experiences while growing up till now. This alone contributes more than any other factor, such as your studies or the tips and tricks you might have picked up from books, blogs, videos, or classes.\n\nIt’s about how you tend to view the world: events, phenomena, problems, and even non-problems. Your curiosity about things beyond your core subjects or profession—how you observe, think, and analyse everyday occurrences—is key.\n\nGoing deeper into these observations requires an empathetic mindset, and this empathy strongly influences your ability to apply first principle thinking.\n\nWhen empathy is lacking, you might unconsciously skip over the basic building blocks of a problem, focusing instead on the problem at hand in isolation and struggling to find solutions.\n\nSo, how can you cultivate more empathy and, in turn, improve your first principle thinking?\n\nI call it “peeling the onion” in daily life: uncovering layers based on what you know, allowing your knowledge to guide you toward the foundational building blocks.\n\nDon’t be surprised if your discoveries differ from others’. The focus should be on sharpening your ability to peel the onion in seemingly trivial situations.\n\nFor example, imagine you’re driving, and a pedestrian suddenly crosses the road in front of your car, forcing you to frustratingly slow down. Instead of venting your frustration with a few choice words, try adopting an empathetic perspective. Ask yourself: Why might they be crossing this way? Is there a lack of safe road-crossing options? If there is a solution, why aren’t they using it? What deeper issues could be at play here?\n\nYou don’t need to find all the answers. In fact, many answers might not exist. The goal is to see if you can identify the fundamental chain of the problem based on your current knowledge.\n\nOver time, this practice enhances your empathetic reserve. Each time you approach a new problem, trivial or significant, you’ll find yourself better equipped to "peel the onion" and apply stronger, more insightful first principle thinking.\n\nEmpathy is the foundation that supports first principle thinking, and practicing it consistently can transform how you analyse and solve problems. Start small, stay curious, and let empathy lead the way.`}
