    content: `Among product folks, first principle thinking is always appreciated, but it is intrinsically linked to how empathetic you are in general.\n\nYour first principle thinking heavily depends on your life experiences while growing up till now. This alone contributes more than any other factor, such as your studies or the tips and tricks you might have picked up from books, blogs, videos, or classes.\n\nIt’s about how you tend to view the world: events, phenomena, problems, and even non-problems. Your curiosity about things beyond your core subjects or profession—how you observe, think, and analyse everyday occurrences—is key.\n\nGoing deeper into these observations requires an empathetic mindset, and this empathy strongly influences your ability to apply first principle thinking.\n\nWhen empathy is lacking, you might unconsciously skip over the basic building blocks of a problem, focusing instead on the problem at hand in isolation and struggling to find solutions.\n\nSo, how can you cultivate more empathy and, in turn, improve your first principle thinking?\n\nI call it “peeling the onion” in daily life: uncovering layers based on what you know, allowing your knowledge to guide you toward the foundational building blocks.\n\nDon’t be surprised if your discoveries differ from others’. The focus should be on sharpening your ability to peel the onion in seemingly trivial situations.\n\nFor example, imagine you’re driving, and a pedestrian suddenly crosses the road in front of your car, forcing you to frustratingly slow down. Instead of venting your frustration with a few choice words, try adopting an empathetic perspective. Ask yourself: Why might they be crossing this way? Is there a lack of safe road-crossing options? If there is a solution, why aren’t they using it? What deeper issues could be at play here?\n\nYou don’t need to find all the answers. In fact, many answers might not exist. The goal is to see if you can identify the fundamental chain of the problem based on your current knowledge.\n\nOver time, this practice enhances your empathetic reserve. Each time you approach a new problem, trivial or significant, you’ll find yourself better equipped to "peel the onion" and apply stronger, more insightful first principle thinking.\n\nEmpathy is the foundation that supports first principle thinking, and practicing it consistently can transform how you analyse and solve problems. Start small, stay curious, and let empathy lead the way.`
